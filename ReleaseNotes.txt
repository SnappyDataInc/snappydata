Release 0.9

- New Features/Fixed Issues

  [SNAP-1597] Support for Partition Pruning for literal expressions (like CAST)

  [SNAP-1478] Fixed Tokenization related issue for subquery, fixing multi-column partition pruning.

  JDBC CDC Streaming support. (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/622)

  [SNAP-1671] 'show tables in app' query now lists list sample table.

  [SNAP-1655] Support for boolean in row table.
    
  [SNAP-1705] Support slash ('/') and special characters in column names.

  [SNAP-1703] Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBound when query has wide schema and a filter clause.

  [SNAP-1698] Snappy Dashboard UI Enhancements

  [SNAP-1651] Fixed LowMemoryException during TPCH query execution on 1TB of TPCH data.

  [SNAP-1664] Fixed LowMemoryException during cluster restart.

  [SNAP-1601] Cleaning the shuffled artifacts asynchronously.
    
  Multi-grid master (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/628)
    
  [SNAP-1545] Redesigned SnappyData Dashboard. Now displays detailed member description, heap and
  off-heap usage along with snappy storage and execution splits. It also displays cluster level
  aggregate Memory and CPU usage.

  [SNAP-1642] Avoid plan caching for queries with subqueries as the underlying changing data does
  not reflect in subsequent query. Added a flag to disable tokenization, if required.

  [SNAP-1663] JDBCSourceAsColumnarStore#doInsert gets connectionType as unknown. As a fix 
  initializing GemFireXDDialect in ServerImpl.start().

  [SNAP-1385] CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fails for replicated tables.

  [SNAP-1221] Unable to restart server nodes in the cluster due to 
  ConflictingPersistentDataException.

  [SNAP-1461] Scalar subquery is only allowed to return a single row, while executing subquery on
  partitioned row table. This is fixed by routing any query with more than one table to lead node.

  [SNAP-1523] Fixed cluster restart after loading the full Airline data which used to give 
  'EmbedSQLException: XCL54.T' earlier.
    
  [SNAP-1520] Switched to upstream Spark from snappy-spark-unsafe. Removed explicit 
  KryoSerializableSerializer registration for UnsafeRow and UTF8String in PooledKryoSerializer and
  instead call just the .register() method which will determine the serializer to be used by
  reflection.

  [SNAP-1615] If a column being aggregated has a NULL value while grouping on a string column, the
  grouping row itself produces a new row with Null column. As a fix, check the actual value while
  scanning row table for string column to decide whether its Null or not.
    
  [SNAP-1486] Remove session field of CachedPlanHelperExec and instead get it from the sqlContext.
  Issue is with "lazy val cleanArgs" in QueryPlan as the serialization stack also suggests. It will
  hold all the arguments of a case class whether or not those are transient. cleanArgs should have
  been a transient lazy val field in Spark (no longer exists in current Spark).

  [SNAP-1454] Support for Off-Heap in column store.

  [SNAP-1610] Remove split connector mode suport as it is replaced by the thin client based smart 
  connector. When a user tries to use the old smart connector, using property 
  "snappydata.store.locators", throw an error. This property is replaced by "snappydata.connection"

  [SNAP-1496] Wide table scan for column tables fails due to 64K limitation of JVM. As a fix, we
  now chunk the different parts of the scan code if the number of columns exceeds 30.
    
  [SNAP-1534] CachedPlanHelper is now removed from the plan information for UI.

  [SNAP-892] SnappyData launch script picks localhost as the locator hostname and ignores 
  conf/locators, when invoked from non-locator host.
    
  [SNAP-1518] sbin/snappy-start-all/.sh does not start lead in a large cluster. As a fix, retry if
  Hive metastore initialization fails due to datastore being no yet available on servers.

  [SNAP-1409] Fixed duplicate result issue with Tokenization. Queries with BroadcastHashJoin and 
  scalar sub-queries, will not be attempted for plan caching.

  [SNAP-1400] When a server/cluster is restarted, sometimes incorrect results are observed. Added a
  check to get buckets from initialized members only.

  [SNAP-1498] Added support for snapshot in smart connector mode. Used procedures to get the 
  snapshot txid for row buffer and use it in column table scan.

  [SNAP-1344] As streaming jobs are recurring jobs, the earlier mechanism of removing dependent jar
  files were broken. Now we maintain a list of jars in the context itself and remove the jars when
  the streaming context is stopped.

  [SNAP-1494]: Dashboard shows an exception stack trace when a server goes down. Exception handled 
  and logged it into log file.

  [SNAP-1399] Updated column stats for complex type which was causing issue while inserting JSON 
  data to column table.
    
  [SNAP-1555] saveAsTable() fails in spark-shell with unknown configuration "column_batch_size".
  As a fix, skip DDL options in ExternalStoreUtils when creating the set of connection properties.

  [SNAP-1542] Ensure that the size of buffer is at least the minimum required.

  [SNAP-1351] After a low memory exception is encountered, the snappy server does not remain stable.
  Snappy threads cannot be interrupted.

  [SNAP-1427] Reduce garbage in column allocators and dictionaries. Use flat ByteBuffer for 
  dictionary key data and added a fully serialized ByteBufferHashMap. Make a clone of StringKey for
  MIN/MAX limits.

  [SNAP-1481] SQL Tab on UI, Description column now displays actual SQL Query string executed
  instead of handler description text.

  [SNAP-1442] Registering row table in catalog after its creation.

  [SNAP-1323] Support parameterized prepared statements for routed queries. Changes for improved
  execution of prepared statement on column table through JDBC route.

  [SNAP-1210] Fix NullPointerException caused when writing dataframe containing timestamp column to
  csv files by registering FastDatePrinter with KryoSerializer.

  [SNAP-1420] Removed the property "config.trace"->"substitutions" which is generating unneccessary
  logs.

  [SNAP-1411] Register dummy output transformations for the stream tables so that the streaming
  context starts from snappy-sql.

  [SNAP-1304] Implementation of Snapshot Isolation in snappydata.

  [SNAP-1435] Added support for off-heap in SnappyMemoryManager.

  [SNAP-1384] Column Table Inserts can fail if generated code is big. Fixed by chunking the code to
  different methods to make java function size well withing 64K.

  [GITHUB-534][SNAP-1480] Code generation failure for nested GROUP BY. Match against variable name
  for dictionary optimization.

  [SNAP-1482] Tableau generated query fails with NumberFormatException. Fix parsing of full 
  engineering format double values.

  [SNAP-1418] Modified JDBC example to accept host and port as user provided args.

  [SNAP-303] Handle non-store hive tables in meta-data queries.

  [SNAP-1459] StackOverflowError running query on Airline (narrow table) with small data set. As a
  fix, registering the classes with a multimap parameter which differentiates between the hashjoin
  and hashaggregate.

  [SNAP-1453] Converting CaseKeyWhen to CaseWhen.

  [SNAP-1361] Added support for schema name in udf while querying e.g. select app.udfname(col_name)
  from table.

  [SNAP-1346] Plan caching ignoring constant values.

  [SNAP-1414] ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when creating sample table out of large dataset. As a
  fix, passing a reasonable initial size for the encoder term.

  Pruning partitions for predicates based on partitioning columns.
  (https://github.com/SnappyDataInc/snappydata/pull/543)

  [SNAP-1441] Limit query on column table gives less number of rows (JDBC).

  [Snap-1286] Thin Client Smart Connector implementation.

  [SNAP-1235] Overhaul SnappyUnifiedMemoryManager to work properly for overflow.

  [SNAP-1413] install_jar does not work for Streaming jobs. Handled classloader in case of 
  Streaming factory as well.

  Removing HashingUtil and using the new methods in ClientResolverUtils added recently to store.
  Added performance benchmark tests for HashSet implementations (Trove, FastUtil, Snappy OpenHashSet)
  SnappyData's OpenHashSet allows for custom hasher for hashCode/equals (like required for snappy-store
  region map) and still manages to match or beat the latest FastUtil's ObjectOpenHashMap while it
  is quite a bit faster compared to older 6.5.x series of FastUtil (as used by parquet-avro, etc.)

  [SNAP-1424] Add a "shouldStop()" call to EncoderScanExec. The "shouldStop()" check is necessary 
  because if the target is a RowWriter (e.g. the parent is an EXCHANGE) then the same row gets 
  reused.

  [SNAP-990] Column wise storage in region for better perf instead of full cachedbatch.
    
  [SNAP-1398] Modified Object and json examples for simpler APIs.

  [SNAP-1395] ElasticSearch connector gives NullPointerException when used with SnappyData.

  Enhancements in SDE

  - For an external table, the LogicalRelation was not storing the table identifier, thus 
  sample table replacement was not happening. Now passing table identifier in the logical relation.


Release 0.8

- Known Issues

  [SNAP-1384] Inserting into or querying a table with wide schema may fail with
  StackOverflowException due to a limitation of JVM.

- New Features/Fixed Issues

  [SNAP-1357] ODBC Driver and Installer. You can now connect to the SnappyData cluster using the
  SnappyData ODBC driver and execute SQL queries.

  [SNAP-1313] Multiple Language Binding using Thrift Protocol. SnappyData now provides support for
  Apache Thrift protocol enabling users to access the cluster from other languages that are not
  supported directly by SnappyData.

  [SNAP-490] Insert Performance Optimizations - Insert into tables is much more optimized and
  performant now. A new insert plan has been introduced which uses code generation
  and a new encoding format.

  Fixes backward compatibility with Spark 2.0.0 - The 0.8 SnappyData release is based on the Spark
  2.0.2 version. And, the SnappyData Smart Connector is now backward compatible with
  Spark 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 releases.

  [SNAP-1146] Fixes RowBuffer bloating. Data was not being aged into the internal compressed
  columnar format leading to unoptimized storage and hence bad query performances.

  [SNAP-1308] Incorrect number of entries displayed on UI if insert was being done from a Spark app
  using Smart Connector.

  [SNAP-1293] The driver process of external Spark app using Smart connector were incorrectly being
  displayed as members of SnappyData cluster.

  [SNAP-1282] The Spark web UI stopped working with SnappyData 0.7. Fixed.

  [SNAP-1243] UI incorrectly displaying multiple entries for the same lead node after restarts.

  [SNAP-1296] ResultsSet obtained from PreparedStatement.executeQuery returned 0 column count
  from its metadata. However SNAP-1311 needs to be fixed for complete support of Prepared
  Statement jdbc api. Being worked on.

  [SNAP-1291] Queries issued with execution-engine=store hint were getting ignored in some cases

  [SNAP-1287] Query execution using indexes on row tables was sometimes throwing ClasscastException

  [SNAP-1269] Create tables using schema of other table but with different column names were using
  column names of the source tables itself.

  [SNAP-1134] A job throwing exception remained in hung state instead of reporting failure

  [SNAP-982] Support for persistent UDFs added. Even after restart the UDF can be used now

  Enhancements in SDE
  - Sample selection logic enhanced. It can now select best suited sample table even if SQL
    functions are used on QCS columns while creating sample tables.

  - Poisson multiplicity generator logic for bootstrap is improved. Error estimated using
    bootstrap are now more accurate.

  - Improved performance of closed-form and bootstrap error estimations.
