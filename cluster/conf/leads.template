# Specify the host name on which a Snappy lead will be started. Also
# specify the startup directory where the logs and configuration files
# for that lead instance are kept. Apart from these two things, snappy
# specific properties can also be passed. If the directory and properties
# are not specified a default directory is created inside the SPARK_HOME directory.
# 
# localhost   -dir=/tmp/data/lead (config args)
#
# Below is an example of how you can specify multiple locators for a lead and also
# set its heap size to 64 GB.
# 
#     localhost   -dir=/tmp/data/server -locators=locator1:9988,locator2:8899 -heap-size=64g
# 
# Another example which shows how to specify a JVM parameter and Spark properties.
# 
#     localhost   -dir=/tmp/data/server -J-XX:MaxPermSize=512m -spark.ui.port=3333 -spark.executor.cores=16
