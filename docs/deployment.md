#Overview
In this section, we discuss the various modes available for collocation of related data and computation.

You can run the SnappyData store in the following modes:

* [Local Mode](affinity_mode/local_mode.md): Used mainly for development, where the client application, the executors, and data store are all running in the same JVM

* [Embedded SnappyData Store Mode](affinity_mode/embedded_mode.md): The Spark computations and in-memory data store run collocated in the same JVM

* [SnappyData Smart Connector Mode](affinity_mode/smartconnector_mode.md): Allows you to work with the SnappyData store cluster from any compatible Spark distribution
