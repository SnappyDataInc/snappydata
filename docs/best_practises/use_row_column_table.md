# Best Practices for Deploying and Managing SnappyData
## Using Index

## Collocated joins

## When do I use Char/Varchar string?
Recommending char/varchar over string if data fits in char/varchar- Since it more efficient compared to clob
## How to do physical design with SnappyData? 
Start with the "designing rowstore dbs" in our current rowstore docs. Needs a lot of refinement. A lot of the principles with colocation still apply. 

## When should I use Row vs Column tables?

## What is the right affinity mode to use? 
Should I run embedded vs SmartConnector? 

## What are the points to consider for capacity planning? 
How much memory, cpu, etc do I need?
