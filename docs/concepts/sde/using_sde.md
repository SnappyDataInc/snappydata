##Using SDE##
In the current release SDE queries only work for SUM, AVG and COUNT aggregations. Joins are only supported to non-samples in this release. The SnappyData SDE module will gradually expand the scope of queries that can be serviced through it. But the overarching goal here is to dramatically cut down on the load on current systems by diverting at least some queries to the sampling subsystem and increasing productivity through fast response times.
