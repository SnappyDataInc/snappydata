##Monitoring the SnappyData Cloud Cluster ##
 You can monitor the SnappyData cluster using SnappyData Pulse Console and the Apache Spark Console. The monitoring tools enable you to observe and record the performance and the activities on the SnappyData cluster.

The SnappyData Pulse Console provides a graphical dashboard which helps you monitor vital, real-time health and performance of SnappyData clusters, members, and tables. 
It provides information on the health, operational and configuration data, system alerts, CPU, disk and memory usage, throughput performance and statistics for system members like locators, leads, stores/servers, connected clients etc.  
It also displays data information for various tables created in the cluster on different nodes/members along with their statistics.

The Apache Spark Console displays useful information about SnappyData. This includes a list of scheduler stages and tasks, summary of tables and memory usage.

###Accessing the Console
