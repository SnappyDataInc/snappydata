#Using Distributed Transactions in Your Applications

A transaction is a set of one or more SQL statements that make up a logical unit of work that you can commit or roll back, and that will be recovered in the event of a system failure. SnappyDataâ€™s unique design for distributed transactions allows for linear scaling without compromising atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties.
