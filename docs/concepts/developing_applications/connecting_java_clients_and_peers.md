#Connecting Java Clients and Peers
A Java application can use the JDBC thin client driver to connect to a SnappyData cluster and execute SQL statements. Or, a Java application can use the JDBC peer client driver to boot a SnappyData peer process and participate as a member of the cluster.

Both drivers use the basic JDBC connection URL of `jdbc:snappydata:` where:

 * `jdbc`: is the protocol.

 * `snappydata`: is the subprotocol.
