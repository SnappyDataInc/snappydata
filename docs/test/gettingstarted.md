# Getting Started with a Trial Account

You can create a free trial account to try out Cloudera Altus and explore how you could quickly provision clusters and run your workloads in the cloud. The Altus trial account gives a single user 30 days of access to all Altus services that are generally available. With a trial account, you can also request access to Altus services that are in Beta release.

A free trial account limits you to one cluster. When your trial account expires, Altus automatically terminates the cluster. Before your trial account expires, contact [Cloudera Sales](https://www.cloudera.com/contact-sales.html) if you wish to continue using Altus after the trial period ends. Find out how you can continue using the cluster and running the workloads that you have created.

Before you can start using Altus, you must have an AWS account or Azure subscription in which to create your Altus clusters. You must also be familiar with AWS or Azure and able to create and configure the resources required for Altus clusters and jobs.

For help with using Altus, join the [Cloudera Altus community](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Altus/ct-p/Altus) and get answers to your Altus questions.
