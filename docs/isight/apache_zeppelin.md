##Using Apache Zeppelin

Apache Zeppelin provides web-based notebooks for data exploration. A notebook consists of one or more paragraphs, and each paragraph consists of a section each for code and results.
Launch Apache Zeppelin from the web browser by accessing the host and port associated with your Apache Zeppelin server. For example, http://`<zeppelin_host>`:`<port_number>`. The welcome page which lists existing notebooks is displayed.  
SnappyData provides predefined notebooks which are displayed on the home page after you have logged into Apache Zeppelin. For more information, see [Using Predefined Notebooks](#predefinednotebook).

Refer to the [Apache Zeppelin documentation](http://zeppelin.apache.org/), for more information.
