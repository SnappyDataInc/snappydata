# List of Properties

The following list of commonly used properties can be set to configure the cluster.  These properties can be set in the **conf/servers**, **conf/leads** or **conf/locators** configuration files.

|Property|Description|Components</br>|
|-|-|-|
|-bind-address|IP address on which the member is bound. The default behavior is to bind to all local addresses.|Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-classpath|Location of user classes required by the SnappyData Server.</br>This path is appended to the current classpath.|Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-critical-heap-percentage<a id="critical-heap-percentage"></a>|Sets the Resource Manager's critical heap threshold in percentage of the old generation heap, 0-100. </br>If you set `-heap-size`, the default value for `critical-heap-percentage` is set to 95% of the heap size. </br>Use this switch to override the default.</br>When this limit is breached, the system starts canceling memory-intensive queries, throws low memory exceptions for new SQL statements, and so forth, to avoid running out of memory.|Server</br>Lead|
|-critical-off-heap-percentage|Sets the critical threshold for off-heap memory usage in percentage, 0-100. </br>When this limit is breached, the system starts canceling memory-intensive queries, throws low memory exceptions for new SQL statements, and so forth, to avoid running out of off-heap memory.|Server|
|-dir|Working directory of the member that contains the SnappyData Server status file and the default location for the log file, persistent files, data dictionary, and so forth (defaults to the current directory).| Server</br>Lead</br>Locator</br>|
|-eviction-heap-percentage|Sets the memory usage percentage threshold (0-100) that the Resource Manager will use to start evicting data from the heap. By default, the eviction threshold is 85.5% of whatever is set for `-critical-heap-percentage`.</br>Use this switch to override the default.|Server</br>Lead</br>|
|-eviction-off-heap-percentage|Sets the off-heap memory usage percentage threshold, 0-100, that the Resource Manager uses to start evicting data from off-heap memory. </br>By default, the eviction threshold is 85.5% of whatever is set for `-critical-off-heap-percentage`. </br>Use this switch to override the default.|Server|
|-heap-size|<a id="heap-size"></a> Sets the maximum heap size for the Java VM, using SnappyData default resource manager settings. </br>For example, -heap-size=1GB. </br>If you use the `-heap-size` option, by default SnappyData sets the critical-heap-percentage to 95% of the heap size, and the `eviction-heap-percentage` to 85.5% of the `critical-heap-percentage`. </br>SnappyData also sets resource management properties for eviction and garbage collection if they are supported by the JVM. |Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-J|JVM option passed to the spawned SnappyData server JVM. </br>For example, use -J-Xmx1GB to set the JVM heap to 1GB.|Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-J-Dgemfirexd.hostname-for-clients<a id="host-name"></a>|Set the IP address or host name that this server/locator sends to JDBC/ODBC/thrift clients to use for connection. The default value causes the client-bind-address to be given to clients. This value can be different from client-bind-address for cases where locators, servers are behind a NAT firewall (AWS for example) where client-bind-address needs to be a private one that gets exposed to clients outside the firewall as a different public address specified by this property. In many cases this is handled by hostname translation itself, i.e. hostname used in client-bind-address resolves to internal IP address from inside but to public IP address from outside, but for other cases this property will be required.|Server|
|-J-Dsnappydata.enable-rls|Enables the system for row level security when set to true.  By default this is off. If this property is set to true,  then the Smart Connector access to SnappyData fails.|
|-J-Dsnappydata.RESTRICT_TABLE_CREATION|Applicable when security is enabled in the cluster. If true, users cannot execute queries (including DDLs and DMLs) even in their default or own schema unless cluster admin explicitly grants them the required permissions using GRANT command. Default is false. |Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|jobserver.waitForInitialization|When this property is set to **true**, the cluster startup waits for the Spark jobserver to be fully initialized before marking the lead node as **RUNNING**. The default is **false**.||
|-locators|List of locators as comma-separated host:port values used to communicate with running locators in the system and thus discover other peers of the distributed system. </br>The list must include all locators in use and must be configured consistently for every member of the distributed system.|Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-log-file|Path of the file to which this member writes log messages (default is snappy[member].log in the working directory. For example, **snappylocator.log**, **snappyleader.log**,**snappyserver.log**. In case logging is set via log4j, the default log file is **snappydata.log** for each of the SnappyData member.)|Server</br>Lead</br>Locator|
|-memory-size|<a id="memory-size"></a>Specifies the total memory that can be used by the node for column storage and execution in off-heap. The default value is 0 (OFF_HEAP is not used by default)|Server</br>Lead|
|-member-timeout<a id="member-timeout"></a>|Uses the member-timeout server configuration, specified in milliseconds, to detect the abnormal termination of members. The configuration setting is used in two ways:</br> 1) First, it is used during the UDP heartbeat detection process. When a member detects that a heartbeat datagram is missing from the member that it is monitoring after the time interval of 2 * the value of member-timeout, the detecting member attempts to form a TCP/IP stream-socket connection with the monitored member as described in the next case.</br> 2) The property is then used again during the TCP/IP stream-socket connection. If the suspected process does not respond to the are you alive datagram within the time period specified in member-timeout, the membership coordinator sends out a new membership view that notes the member's failure. </br>Valid values are in the range 1000-600000 milliseconds.|Server</br>Locator</br>Lead|
|-peer-discovery-address|Use this as value for the port in the "host:port" value of "-locators" property |Locator|
|-peer-discovery-port|Port on which the locator listens for peer discovery (includes servers as well as other locators).  </br>Valid values are in the range 1-65535, with a default of 10334.|Locator|
|-rebalance<a id="rebalance"></a>|Triggers a rebalancing operation for all partitioned tables in the system. </br>The system always tries to satisfy the redundancy of all partitioned tables on new member startup regardless of this option.|Server|
|-spark.sql.codegen.cacheSize<a id="codegencache"></a>|Size of the generated code cache. This effectively controls the maximum number of query plans whose generated code (Classes) is cached. Default is 2000. |Lead|
|-spark.jobserver.port|The port on which to run the jobserver. Default port is 8090.||
|-spark.jobserver.bind-address|The address on which the jobserver listens. Default address is 0.0.0.||
|-spark.jobserver.job-result-cache-size|The number of job results to keep per JobResultActor/context. The default is 5000.||
|-spark.jobserver.max-jobs-per-context|The number of jobs that can be run simultaneously in the context. The Default is 8.||
|<a id="sparkdrivermaxresult"></a>-spark.driver.maxResultSize|Limit of the total size of serialized results of all partitions for each action (e.g. collect). The value should be at least 1MB or 0 for unlimited. Jobs will be aborted if the total size of results is above this limit. Having a high limit may cause out-of-memory errors in the lead. The default max size is 1GB. |Lead|
|-spark.executor.cores|The number of cores to use on each server. |Lead|
|-spark.local.dir|Directory to use for "scratch" space in SnappyData, including map output files and RDDs that get stored on disk. This should be on a fast, local disk in your system. It can also be a comma-separated list of multiple directories on different disks.|Lead|
|-spark.network.timeout|The default timeout for all network interactions while running queries.|Lead|
|-thrift-ssl-properties|Comma-separated SSL properties including:</br>`protocol`: default "TLS",</br>`enabled-protocols`: enabled protocols separated by ":"</br>`cipher-suites`: enabled cipher suites separated by ":"</br>`client-auth`=(true or false): if client also needs to be authenticated </br>`keystore`: Path to key store file </br>`keystore-type`: The type of key-store (default "JKS") </br>`keystore-password`: Password for the key store file</br>`keymanager-type`: The type of key manager factory </br>`truststore`: Path to trust store file</br>`truststore-type`: The type of trust-store (default "JKS")</br>`truststore-password`: Password for the trust store file </br>`trustmanager-type`: The type of trust manager factory </br> |Server|

Other than the above properties, you can also refer the [Configuration Parameters section](/reference/configuration_parameters/config_parameters.md#property-names) for properties that are used in special cases.

## SQL Properties

These properties can be set using a `SET SQL` command or using the configuration properties in the **conf/leads** file. The `SET SQL` command sets the property for the current SnappySession while setting it in **conf/leads** file sets the property for all SnappySession.

For example: Set in the snappy SQL shell

```pre
snappy> connect client 'localhost:1527';
snappy> set snappydata.column.batchSize=100k;
```
This sets the property for the snappy SQL shell's session.

Set in the **conf/leads** file
```pre
$ cat conf/leads
node-l -heap-size=4096m -spark.ui.port=9090 -locators=node-b:8888,node-a:9999 -spark.executor.cores=10 -snappydata.column.batchSize=100k
```

| Property | Description|
|--------|--------|
|-snappydata.column.batchSize |The default size of blocks to use for storage in SnappyData column and store. When inserting data into the column storage this is the unit (in bytes or k/m/g suffixes for unit) that is used to split the data into chunks for efficient storage and retrieval. </br> This property can also be set for each table in the `create table` DDL. Maximum allowed size is 2GB. Default is 24m.|
|-snappydata.column.maxDeltaRows|The maximum number of rows that can be in the delta buffer of a column table. The size of delta buffer is already limited by `ColumnBatchSize` property, but this allows a lower limit on the number of rows for better scan performance. So the delta buffer is rolled into the column store whichever of `ColumnBatchSize` and this property is hit first. It can also be set for each table in the `create table` DDL, else this setting is used for the `create table`|
|-snappydata.sql.hashJoinSize|The join would be converted into a hash join if the table is of size less than the `hashJoinSize`.  The limit specifies an estimate on the input data size (in bytes or k/m/g/t suffixes for unit). The default value is 100MB.|
|-snappydata.sql.hashAggregateSize|Aggregation uses optimized hash aggregation plan but one that does not overflow to disk and can cause OOME if the result of aggregation is large. The limit specifies the input data size (in bytes or k/m/g/t suffixes for unit) and not the output size. Set this only if there are queries that can return large number of rows in aggregation results. The default value is set to 0 which means, no limit is set on the size, so the optimized hash aggregation is always used.|
|-snappydata.sql.planCacheSize|Number of query plans that will be cached.|
|-spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold|Configures the maximum size in bytes for a table that is broadcast to all server nodes when performing a join.  By setting this value to **-1** broadcasting can be disabled. |
|-snappydata.sql.hashJoinSize|The join would be converted into a hash join if the table is of a size that is less than the **hashJoinSize**. The limit specifies an estimate on the input data size (in bytes or k/m/g/t suffixes for a unit). The default value is 100MB.|
|-snappydata.linkPartitionsToBuckets|When this property is set to **true**, each bucket is always treated as a separate partition in column/row table scans. When this is set to **false**, SnappyData creates only as many partitions as executor cores by clubbing multiple buckets into each partition when possible. The default is **false**.|
|-snappydata.preferPrimaries|Use this property to configure your preference to use primary buckets in queries. This reduces the scalability of queries in the interest of reduced memory usage for secondary buckets. The default is **false**.|
|-snappydata.sql.partitionPruning|Use this property to set/unset the partition pruning of queries.|
|-snappydata.sql.tokenize|Use this property to enable/disable tokenization.|
|snappydata.cache.putIntoInnerJoinResultSize| Use this property with extreme limits such as 1K and 10GB. The default is 100 MB.|
|-snappydata.scheduler.pool|Use this property to define scheduler pool to either default or low latency. You can also assign queries to different pools.|
|-snappydata.enable-experimental-features|Use this property to enable and disable experimental features. You can call out in case some features are completely broken and need to be removed from the product.|

## SDE Properties

The [SDE](../aqp.md) properties can be set using a Snappy SQL shell (snappy-sql) command or using the configuration properties in the **conf/leads** file. </br>
The command sets the property for the current SnappySession while setting it in **conf/leads** file sets the property for all SnappySession. 

For example: Set in the  Snappy SQL shell (snappy-sql)

```pre
snappy> connect client 'localhost:1527';
snappy> set snappydata.flushReservoirThreshold=20000;
```
Set in the **conf/leads** file
```pre
$ cat conf/leads
node-l -heap-size=4096m -spark.ui.port=9090 -locators=node-b:8888,node-a:9999 -spark.executor.cores=10 -snappydata.column.batchSize=100k -spark.sql.aqp.error=0.5
```
This sets the property for the snappy SQL shell's session.

| Properties | Description |
|--------|--------|
|-snappydata.flushReservoirThreshold|Reservoirs of sample table will be flushed and stored in columnar format if sampling is done on the base table of size more than flushReservoirThreshold. The default value is10,000.</br> This property must be set in the **conf/servers** and **conf/leads** file.|
|-spark.sql.aqp.numBootStrapTrials|Number of bootstrap trials to do for calculating error bounds. The default value is100. </br>This property must be set in the **conf/leads** file.|
|-spark.sql.aqp.error|Maximum relative error tolerable in the approximate value calculation. It should be a fractional value not exceeding 1. The default value is0.2. </br>This property can be set as connection property in the Snappy SQL shell.|
|-spark.sql.aqp.confidence|Confidence with which the error bounds are calculated for the approximate value. It should be a fractional value not exceeding 1. </br> The default value is0.95. </br>This property can be set as connection property in the Snappy SQL shell.|
|-sparksql.aqp.behavior|The action to be taken if the error computed goes outside the error tolerance limit. The default value is`DO_NOTHING`. </br>This property can be set as connection property in the Snappy SQL shell.|
